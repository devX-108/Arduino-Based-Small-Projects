Arduino Mini Projects Collection
This repository is a curated collection of my small but impactful Arduino-based electronics projects, developed using various sensors, modules, and components from a standard Arduino kit. Each project is self-contained, well-documented, and intended for learning, experimentation, or as a base for further development.

🚀 What’s Inside
Each folder in this repository represents a separate mini-project, containing:

🔌 Circuit Schematics or Wiring Details (as images or .txt)

📄 Arduino Code (.ino files)

📝 Brief Project Description

📸 Images or Videos of the Working Prototype on my YouTube Channel

💡 Purpose
These projects serve as practical examples to explore basic to intermediate concepts in embedded systems, IoT, sensors, and automation using Arduino. They are suitable for:

Hobbyists and beginners exploring Arduino

Students looking for reference implementations

Anyone interested in DIY electronics

📂 Project Topics (Examples)
Digital Temperature & Humidity Logger (DHT11)
